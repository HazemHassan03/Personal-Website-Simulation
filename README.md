# Personal-Website-Simulation
I developed a responsive landing page that functions like a personal website. This page was created by me using HTML and CSS and is fully responsive on all devices using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries.

The page consists of 14 sections: Landing, Articles, Gallery, Features, Testimonials, Team Members, Services, Our Skills, How It Works, Events, Pricing Plans, Top Videos, Stats, and Request A Discount.

The header of the page is always fixed at the top. Clicking on the buttons in the navigation bar takes you to their respective sections. Hovering over the "Other Links" in the header reveals a large navigation rectangle to aid navigation.

In the landing section, clicking the bottom-arrow takes you to the next section "Articles". 

There are enjoyable animations when hovering over most of the items on the page, so interact now with every item in the pages to see what happens.

The page also includes a button thareturnsrn you to the top. 

Last but not least, I customized the scroll bar styles to complement the design of the page.
